1111111 with 1 large Argolic shield, with 111111ιί111, with the
κοντος, 11 δολιχοσκιον αγχος (the long spear), which he 11
darting at the boar, 111 wearing 1 short rest or 1111111, 111
reaching 11 his 111111. 'l'lre next to this 11 ΠΑΦΟΝ, who 11
running, and in the act 11 shooting at the bour with his bow 111
arrow3 his quiret ia hanging on his baclr, and his head 11 .
111111 with a helmet, embellished 1111111 high lophos, or crest.
After this figure is placed a bird 11111111 than 11111 above-men·
tioned, which appears to be only an ornament to fill up the
space, 111111 a stop 11 the subject. This continues with the'
wild boar, which is already pierced behind with two κοντα, 11
long spears, and three ακοντια, 11 short ones, 11111 from the
bow 11 Paphon. Under the animalis tbe figure 11111 111111
11111111, named ΦΙΛΟΝ, holding 1 long spear, bnt extended
11 the ground, as 11 killed by the boar, which is running 11 fult
apeed, 111 11 met by θΕΡΣΑΝΔΡΟΣ, who pierces his head
witha swerd. Only one 11 the figures is armed with 1 helmet,
and 111 with 1 shield; this is the terminetion 11 the subject.
’1111 remaining part 11 the 11111 11 occupied by 1111 winged
sphinrea, with human heads, and the bodies and 1111 11 tions;
they 1111 each other, and 111 couched upon their hinder legs,
the foremost being erect: between them is 1 111111 resemblinga
¹ 11111. The figures were evidently drawn with great 1111, 111
11111111 with difficulty, before the facility 11 efter times had
been attained. No better specimen 11 the unimprored archaic
style can well be seen: there 111 natural motion in all the
ligures, attended, however, with the rigid formality and elaboss
rate, stiffness 11 the earliest antiquity. ’1111111111 the colour
11 borwood, being a light yellow; the figures are composed 11
the two 1111111, blaclr 111 11111 111; the muscles 11 the body,
111 the plaits 11 the 11111, 111 represented hythe paint being
acratched with 1 sharp instrument until the natural 11111111 the
earth is seen. The 11111111 extremely line, aud the 1111 is
rurpriaingly light and thio. It is difficult, and indeed impossi-
ble to determine its age3 the style 111111 design, however, but
more particularly the rery ancient and cinicus 11111 11 the letters,
induces me to place it about 700 years 1111111 the Christian 111.

,Noae 11 the names on the vase are known in heroic history
except 111111 11 Agamemnon and Thersandroa. The latter 1111
probably son 11 Sisyphus, king 11 ‘Frph'yrr (1111111111 Corinth.)
'lbere was, however, another Thersandros, son 11 Polynices
