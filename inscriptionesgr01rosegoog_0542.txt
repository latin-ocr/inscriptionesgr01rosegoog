and trees and pots speak in AEsop’s Fables‚ yet even
. AEsop’s beasts talk‘with more propriety, than their-master
is supposed to do here. Ι

l can 'scaree think Mr. ‘Chishull in earnest, when be
would do such honour to this supposed statue. AEsop was
no statuary, he is not said¹ to ¹have had ’Alenpol any
’ brothers. lt is singular and without examples¹, that three
artificers should be ascribed to one statue: uor can Ἀδελφοῖ
ever be allowed to mean no more than Συνεργοὶ.

Well: if the statne is turned to Phanodicus himself‚'
when he tells us he gave the vessels, yet in the next clause,
he is a mercfistatue again; if noy mischance‚ says he,¹
happens to me, the Sigeans areto meitd me: Ι tvos made
byAEsop and his brethren. And yet he speaks like a pot
more than a statue: for if a statue is delaced it cannot
be mended, bot a new one most be· made. But a pot
bruised or cracked may easily find a doctor.

Mr. Chishull reads those words thus: 'Eds dd τι πάσχω

nehela, ι’νεντ [ἐῶ] myricis. But he finds great difficulty
in accounting for the dot and space in the middle ol praela ausu.
· He dislikes also ἐῶ, sino: because then there is a letter¹
erased and not accounted for. He prefers therefore ἐρέω
dicam, jubebo: buthe does not reflect that this way he
makes a letter e too much. Besides that, allowing ἐρέω it
must not be σιγειεῖς, but orys'reoow or σύγείεσιν. Ι cannot
but think he will allow my ἵν’ ‹ivdc'so to be true and certain.
’ The difficulties that induced Mr. Chishull to think the.
‚upper inscription more recent than the other, and to he
an interpolation of it, are these: that the letters H arrd
Ω are there, hut in the lower, in their stead E, O: that it
is ὑποκρητῆριον in the upper, but ln the lower (a word
he says unheard ot' to us) ἑπὶστατὸς. Now both the differeuces
‘of writing and ol that word are easily accounted for io my ’
explication. For the two inscriptions are transcripts from the
eugravings on two vessels made hy different artists; each
of which spelt and spoke his own way.

Ἐπίστατος is not so unknown a word, we read in Aris·
tophanes τοῦ ’πιστάτου that is, τοῦ ‹intortis-oo: whose nomi·
