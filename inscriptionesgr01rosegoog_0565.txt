Μι. Κ. tirst represents this famous decree as rt stands sn the
edition ol Glareanus, with the marginal variations3 nestas it
is given hy Gronovins3 thirdly‚ ss the Bishop ol Chester has

published it, with the various readings nt' the Oxl'ord MSS.;
and lsstly, ss the learned prelata himself would read it. Μι.
Knight decides, however, that most of the Bishop's emenda·
tions are either unnacesssry‚ οι tend to eject every curicus

' provincial peculiarity ιΙιιι is not readily understood, and ιο fill

its place with ι word from the known dialects.

The Bishop would write Truocrop for Τιμοθιοι, ιισομξιν
(ιι ιιι suppose.) sor κιθαρισιν, and μυσοι for μῦθοιε bnt Mr.
Κ. thinks that this difference ιιιι confined to the pronunciatinn

alone, snd did not effect their orthography. Are we then to ¹

suppose that, in all the places in which Aristophanes employs

. the ο lor the θ, he only means ιο accommodate the Lacedaemnuisn

pronunciation ιο the Attic orthographyl tf we he certain of
any thing, waere certain that they ιι Ιιιιι wrote σιοι lor θιοι,
though we are willing ιο grant Μι. K„ hut for another reason,
that the Lacedaemoniam did not write Truoosop in this decree.
Μι. Κ. objects to μυσοι, because it would confound μνθοι
with sdifferent word, but his own μιτω is liable ιο thesaure
objection We think that no doubt can be entertained ol' κοιιιι-
τοτορ, which ιι also approved by Mr. Kc but we cannot
agree with his οτιμοσδι, for οτιμοσδει, ιι the present time
seems necessary. Out nl ποιτον others have made ποιων, with
which Μι. Κ. ιι not consented, preferring ποιτοι, which ιι
pnt for ποισον, which is put lor ιιοισοσαν. We ιιι almost
tempted to suspect some grievous mistalre ol the press in this
pmiliia 3ε3οχθοι, follows φο οι φορ, which the editor of
the decree rejects. but Mr. Κ. thinks that rt related either to
the senate which enscted, οι ιο the senator who mered, the
ds'crse3 prohshly ιο the latter. Allowing this, what part οῖ
speech rs φο οι φορ t—-Tnas our readers may judge what clear,
pleasant, and consistent things various readings sometimes ιἰι,
we will give them a very short passage of this famous decree,
accompsnied with the mrlfirl collatinus. The first we take frons
