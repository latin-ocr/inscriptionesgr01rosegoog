3⁴2 serenurx.

notive some of the old grammerlens mulie ἐπιστάτης, end some
ἐπίσταται. lt certainly means ln the poet some houshold
vessel: aod why not the same as in the inscription? the Scho-

liests knew not what lt' was, us their various interpretations ἵ

shew. Ἑτίστατος therefore we heve, but the other word

rirorpnro‘pror, which is supposed the inore recent, is, except κ

in this inscription, wholly l suppose unknown. lt'sno wonder

ιῐο me at all, that the very same day, the very same vessel might ³
be called by one tredesmen, ὖποκρητῆριου, and by another, ’

interam: each name being made by workmen, when thet
form of vessel was invented ; eud both talen from the use of it,
according to the different ideas of standing on end supporting.
The other difficulty is H, end Ω, which appenring in the first
inscription, seems to derogete from the antiquity of this monu-
ment, if it be not supposed to be recenter than the other. But
in my explicetion there's uo feer of that. If one writ η and o,
end the other worknren e and o, it proves that itwes just upon
the invention of those long vowels, before the new orthography
wer settled. Nor need we suppose that Simonides first found

· ont those letters, but first carried thern to Athens3 whichin ,

thet place would entitle him to the invention. Ἑρμοκράτους
end κρητῆρα are full asold ns Ἑρμοκράτους and κρατῆραι and
πρυτανήιον in the former older then npurarsiov: if it be writ ’

πρυτανεῖου; end not s for H, πρυτανήιον. lin ηιον maybe r

either pronounced nod melre a syllable3 or be adjunctum (that
is, ἰῶτα subscriptum) iu the AEolien manner, es l remember
these twoverses of Sappho in Hephaestion:

Hp’ ’ἔτι Διυομὲνει τιὸ Τυρῥακήιο
Τ ἄρμενα λαμπρὰ κέατ’ ἑν μυρσιυὴιυ.

Nny, to me, though both workmen seem illiternte enough,
the oue having ουκοεῖιοι, the other σιγευοῦσι, neither words
grammaticelly spelt3 yet the engraver of the letter seems the

. more ignorant. He indecere, end οἴσουσι, ἁδελφὸς, ridude chyi·- ’

nte3 the former hes ἠθμὸς with α lene, Mr Chishull would
mend our present orthography, end from this authority would

heve us henceforwurd read eud write ἠθμὸς end not ἠθμὸς. l
But we must corr'ect then twenty authors who hove it in the
‘compound α’τηθεῖυ and ἆτήθημα; end not (es the espirete would ι

requireit) ι’φηθεῖυ nndriqlddryno. And so it is uri‘roideltqloe 3

and not aspirete αυθάδαλφος. - The letter's, ignorence too
