appears in the making the snrne position of σι”γμα iu both lines
of the Βουστροφηδδν, thus 2: whereas in one it ought to be
5, and in the other ζ.

‘¹ Sir,

“l have writ too nrucb for nn extempore re-
mark, und too riute for an neumata discussion, if1 wau amongst
my books. lf yon show it to Mt. chishutt, pruy let it go uo
further3 nor bring me into a public dispute. l’lt disputo with
uobody about nothing; muchlena about this with α person for
whose great learning 1 bave no jun-respect, and whose labours
in band Ι winh so weh to.

ΙἸΙ add one remark, because bere's prper yet to spate.
Monsieur Touruefort brought out of Greece a short inscrip-
tion on a basin ut Delos, on which formerly stood α coloss

statue of Apollo; the letters are of the same form with nur
Sigeon monument3 ‚in present letters thus:

oa Foro λιθο ou nvbpror κω σο σφαλῇς.
Father Moutfnucon reads it thus:
Ἐν τῶ λίθω εἰμὶ ἀνδρίας καὶ rb σφέλας.
In lupide sum stabnt et basis. ’
’ This ἰα justly censured 'by Mr. Chishull, as both varying

from the original, and void of all good senae. Mr. Cb'nbull· ι

goes exactly to the letters, und reads thus;
ov αὑτοῦ λίθου εἰμὶ ἀνδρίας καὶ ro σφέλα.
Nou num ejudem lapidis et statuo et bruis.

But wiu 211 snbmboion, ouen tbb mse seems too low, oud
not wortby tu bo sud to uu speotdtmng For what woudathnt
' tbo statue nd benit nbould be ofin-‚different utonuu,¹ when in thu
greater aurun 'tuan scaren em otherwise, ὡς statuo being
tired and solderod‘ to tbe bano. 1²11 try my hard nt it, aud
shall keep exactly to tho tettan only beg leave to supponem
Τσν, which iu above myrum moyrbuvn boen worn ont·attbe
beginning. Irend. σοῦ αὑτοῦ λίθου αἷμ’, κ.σ.·λ. Ex eodm

lupide sum statua et bonis. Thotis to the then pronnnoittion,

and in tbo now orthography ’ ’

Which is a true Iumbic verre, aud thot establishen the cor·

rection. This'iudeed was worth tellings to be both of the same
stone, in a coloss, was both costly aud extraordinary.'’
