still further marks ol AEolism: lor il it was not AEolip, there is
uo doubt to be made, but that we should have there had TOF
Afro? ΛΙΘΟΡ, not‘l'O Atro ΛΙΘΟε lor why should the
power of the aspiration Waw, he left to be thrice understood,
when ’tis plain, that a character expressive ol it was reedy at
hand? The reason ol our meeting with such instances as
ΔΙΟΝΥΣΟ is, that in other parts of Greece there was no capital
character denoting the aspiration Wuw. this, as well as the
other aspiration He, was lest to be ¹supplied by the common
. norma loquendi. On the contrary? supposing the inscription to
be AEolic‚ it will be liable to no such objectiou; the power of
the words will be τω nw‘rro λιθω unt. The T, which l hare
prefixed to the Ο, ia absolutely necessary ; for owror destitute
of the article never means the rame. Now my hand is in, Ι shall
add another conjecture about the genuine form of this inscrip-
tion, which Ι am persuaded has been still further corrupted.
'Ihe reading, which now prevails, is no verser and the lauguage,
when considered as prore, is vitious. The nature of prose re-
quires the, article along with criptas, as well as with σφελας, ὁ
culpano, or rather ὁ τε ανδριας rat το σφελας. And now we
have no sooner rectihed the language, but what confirma the
emendation instead ol prose there tums out a complete lambio
verse, to be thus pronounced, Trowror λιθωμ’ ὁ τ’ sulpur ror
το nochor· or Towro >aud ημ’; for the AEolians might per-

haps allow ol this hiatus, though the Atheniens did not. The ἵ

Υ in ΑΡΥΤΟ l imagine hasbeen written near the F iu the later
times, by way ol explicating of the antiem power of that ligure;
for what is now written duros is never used as a trisyllable.

Yon proceed sdly, “ lll allow you your opinion, it does by
no means conclude against mine. For instance, if the AEoliaus
wrote unu arrd the more modern Greeks ΕΙΜ 1, does it therefore
follow, that the more ancient Greeks did not write EM13 For
he pleased to observo, that you are bound to maintain a negative
illation.'’ You must mean an illatiou universally negative. But,
with submissim, l conceive the csse to be ol a very different

nature. You essert, that what was written E by the ancient ¹

Greeks was sometimes pronounced El: and as a proof ol this

you appeal to EMl in the Delian inscription. But this amounts ¹
tono proof, unless it he impossible, that EMl in that inscription r

should have arry other power than ElMl.' Whereas l hare as·
