· ἰ vead arrd distiogirish the second inscription thus:

boolteov aial τοῦ Ἑρμοκράτους τοῦ Προκονησ(ίου καγώ)
Et ego sum (donum) Phanodici Hermocrstis F. Proconesii.¹

This, l tale it, was eugraved upon the second vessel;
aud hy καγῶ (and Ι too) indicates both itself and the other.

It follows in the inscription κρατῆρα redolemus
irai ἡθμόν ris Πρυτανεῖον adrosa μνῆμα σιγειεῦσι. As iu
other places of this inscription, arrd many others, both Greek
and Latin, there's a plain blunder of the stone-entier
sidona for ἔδωκαρ aud the necessity of the sense obliges us
to charge him with another blunder in this same word ἔδωκα
fordione, ss in the former inscription. tf he had not tunde
κ for e, I should have suspected he made it in the first ¹
ἔδωκας because he might take κάγώ to belong to the latter ‚
clause a‘rrd not to the first. But egregious negligence in
making a consonant for a vowel prevents this conjecture.

It follows ’Edu δέ τι πάσχω μελεδα sven eo σιγειες.
Between rvsv aud so one letter is worn out in the stone:
that is not hard to be supplied, and I read it thus: 'Edu
δέ τι πάσχω settle ἵν’ ‹ivds'w erysreor. Si quid autem
(detrimenti) passus fuerit, curo (erit) ubi opus habeam Sige-
ensibus. Μελέδ[η (AEolice Mehesdlo] is in this sense used
by Hippocrates: and ‘ir’ ἑνδέω is known, arrd common
Greek, and comes most pat to the sentence. The graver·
seems to have missed the Iota in or‘yerss, but it may be

read σωγειεῖς in the nominative ease: remedium (erunt) ,

Sigeenses. The last clause is irai μ’ ἐποίησεν αἵσωπος
καὶ ἀδελφοὶ. Et fecit me AEsopus et fratres. This well
agrees with the three vessels, il we suppose these inscriptions
engraved on them, AEsop, a silversmith or brazier, and his
two brothers, made each of them one of them.

I shall* now consider Mr. Chishull's explication, where
it differs stom my own. He supposes this stone to have
been the basis to a· statue ol Phanodicus: that this in·
scription is spoken as in the person of Phanodicus: that
the inscription was at first but one, the lower of the two:
the upper being an interpolation ol the lower, wrote many.
years aster it, and adapted to the writing and language ·
ol' that respective recenter nge„

Now, in the first place, there are no lootsteps lest ol
this supposed statue, it is mere conjecture, arrd if it arisos
