“ Tun vilingen 'of Mertbse informed me, that n Jew ol ·

Corinth, who bad lntely been. digging in this spot, had found
several vases. On my return to Corinth, 1 immediately called
upon him, and found them heaped in a corner, with other
rubbish. He, however, knew, or pretended to know, the value
ol an inscribed vase, which he showed rne; sud which, with
some difficulty, Ι bought ol him. The design oi the figures, and
the forms of the letters, ure of the most ancient character3 and
probably no vase of terra-cotta has yet been discovered that be·
longs to aperiod ao remote. lt is divided into two compart-
ments, one above the other, in which sre lions, bulla, stngs,
goets, birds, and dowers, which are not historicul, but merely
oruamental. The cover, however, is'ol the greatest interest;
it represents the chase ol a wild honr, in which the nume os
each oi the actore is written hy his side, iu letters of the most
ancient date. The subject is opened by a figure dressed in a
long garment, and carrying acuduceur iu his right hand, with
the inscription ArAMEMNOrv‘. The next figure is a female
‚named ΑΛΚΑ. She places her right haud on the bend of a
boy, who holds a parazonion, or short sword, in his left hand,
and whose nemeis ΔΟΡΕΜΑΧΟΣ, written from right to left.
The next figure iss female named ΣΑΚΕΣ, holding a singular
aud indefinite object in her band. This appears to be the con·
clusion nithe subject, aaa bird is placed after this figure, which
is often found on the most ancient vasen, markingthe termina·
tion of the story, or the separation oi one subject from nnotlrer.
The figure which commences the other subject is ΑΝΔΡΥΤΟΣ,

· ‘The inscriptions are here given in letters ot meromontem, in
order to render thern legible.
