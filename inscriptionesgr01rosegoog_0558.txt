which he produces in conformity with a canon oi Dawes, thate
is never put for er, it aeeds no remark3 he having iu thesaure
page translated his present optative by a past subjunctive “scri-

regular Doric aud Auic genitires in the example which he cites ;
aad that so tar from the e and ει not being commutable in dii· ·
ferent dialects, they are commutable in the same3 the coins of
Agathocles having ΑΓΑΘΟΚΛΕΟΣ or ΑΓΑΘΟΚΛΕΙΟΣ, accord·
ingly as the space was less or greater3 and no one will suspect
that ia Sicily, aiter the Macedonian conquest, the e stood for
an η, or had any power but its own.

The square letter, the third in the eigbth line, is not employ-
ed asapany where else that l know; bat is used asadon the
very ancient coins oi Thebes, and may possibly be sach bere3

Hesychius interprete ἑφιερεῖα to be rai ἐπὶ τοῖς ‘repelare ἀπο-
θυόμενα, which affords a meaning sufficiently near to that here

regard to tense, sense, aad syntax, might perhaps translate, “ tic
sacro obstringetur hinc scripto‚” or “quod hinc scriptum est:’'
but Mr. J. M„ witb more justice, treats bis own Greek as it
demeres, aod scarcely retains a traco of it iu his own equally
original Latia, “ hic ad templum inhiberetur eo quod ibi scriptum
ert:” Sureiy it might bare occurred to him, that if ἱερῷ signi-
fied either the temple, or the fine, it would require the article

’ joined with enixurae to ἱερῷ, some word, such as conpagine,
is wanted to make a sentence-cirri τῆς connexius τῷ ἱερῷ ἂν
