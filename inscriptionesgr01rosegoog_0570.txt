sud Argia, vrbo was with the Greeks at the Trojau war. The
hunt, which is here represented is unknown in ancient history.
- Those which have come down to usare the chase of the Caly-
donian boar, aud that ol Parnassos, where Ulysscs was wound·
ed¹. The Cromyou sow, and Erymanthiau bour, which were
killed by Theseus and Hercules, seem not to have afforded the
opportunity of a general hunt, like the two above-mentioned.

The wild boar chose is not au uncommou delineation ou
lictilevases. There is one of great interest and remote antiqui·
ty, in the collection of Sir W. Hamiltou, which is at present iu
the British Museum ². lt hus been supposed that these reses
were the Therikleau cupa, celebrated in antiquity, and thus
named from their maker Therikles³. lt appears that the ma-
nufacture was not confined to any particular material. ln
Dr. Bentley's dissertation upon Therikleau cups, ure cited tha
authors, who have written ou this subject.

These tombs probably did uot coutaiu vases or such velue
as those louud in the sepulchres ol Corinth; all ol which,
Strabo* says, were opened iu the time of Julius Caesar, when
the earthen aud bronze vases⁵ found in them were sold l'or high
prices, aud sent to Rome. That city was thus copiously sup-
plied with the vases that had been iuterred with the Corinthiun ·
dead ⁸. The vein of earth being lost, they became source, aud
the value was enhanced, not only by their great rarity, but by
their wonderful beauty. This introduction ol objecta of Corin·
thian ort must have been a source of improvement lor Roman
artists, by whom elegauce was not much known or studied at
that period; though it is evideut tbey began to have a teste lor it,
from the eagerness with which they sought for works ol tlrat
kind. Corinth was lor along time the great emporium of every
thing that was elegunt in the arts3 aud was, according to the
observatiou ol Paul Orosius, lor many ages, “velut officina
omnium artificium, atque artificiorum.'”
