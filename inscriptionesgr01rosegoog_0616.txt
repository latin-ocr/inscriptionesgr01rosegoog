“kept it from being burthened with contributione leviad by the
pirates, and with debts contracted in consequence of them.''

Besides Mr. Reurens’s copy, audone in the Person papers,
which is hyan unknown hand, and ends line 48, lbere been fa·
voured by the Rev. Dr. Ramsden‚ late Senior and Deputy Professor ⁶
ol Divinity, with his own copy, and with one made by Mr. Davies,
formerly Senior. These papers‚ especially Dr. Ramsden's, have
been highly nselul; but after line 47. the marble is so corroded
and discoloured, especially towards the end of the lines, that many
words must be left uncertain.

, Line 8. 'l'hs marble has ΚΑΘΙΔΙΑΝ. It is remarkable

that thia very fault occurs in another Teuiau decree. See p. 286.

and 54. ΑΤΟΝ for ΑΥΤΟΝ, and this itrelf wrong in the former
place.

Line 25· ΙΛΚΥΣΕΝ. The other copies fluctuate between
this and ΙΔΡΥΣΕΝ, which is a very ingenious emerrdntion, and
rnay have been written by the author of the dec'ree3 unt the stoue

whether we should not read κατ’ εἵλην ff in their several componier,

Latin, collegia. (rard εἴλας Herodot. Ι. 202.) As to the very

“ difficult passage in the etth and following lines, ἆτῶν is also

the supplement of Dr. Ramsden. Assuming ἵδρυσεν, and sup-
posing a number to have been omitted before ἑτῶν, we may nans-
lste; and to tlte other debts, making u fresli scere from tlte
date ‘ff the (new) boam, lle flred the interest ut α drachma, (per
mina per montli, eqnal to our twelve per cent. per annum) ut
simple interest, (and with a respite οῖ) ...years and more.

Line 47. The other copies have ΗΜΩΝ sor .ΗΛΟΙ.
Either . ΗΛΟ. or .ΗΛΩ. seems ceitain. Dr. Ramsden's copy
proceeds thus3
