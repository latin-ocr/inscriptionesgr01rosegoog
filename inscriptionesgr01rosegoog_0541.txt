not from the matter of the inscription, it has no basis to
support it. Indeed a statue has nothing to do with a Pry-
tsneum, a hall, a dining-room for the magistrates and
strangers of note, where there was good cheer at the
public charge. Mr. Chishull, in his learned notes, has
shewed this, arrd a whole book might be writ about it.
Resides a statue is quite dispropnrtioned to ,so sinall a bene·
fection as three vessels for drinking, which probably were
but of copper. And, that in those early days, when this
inscription was made, statuaries were either none or very
few, especially in so mean a town as Sigeum. That the
upper inscription should be a whole age junior to the lower,
is improbable at first thought. lf oue is younger than the
other, surely the lower. Would any one leave the upper,
the conspicuous part of the stone, bare: and write the in·
scriptiou at the bottom, to be fouled by the soil, and
covered by tlre nettles?

³But above all, the improprieties of style, if the inscrip-
tiou is spoken of Phanodicus or his statue, are most shoclsing
and indefensible.

rlnd l‘ gave three vessels to the Prytaneum. What! The
statue gave the vessels? Tell us not so for common
sense's sale. And yet take notice, if the upper shorter in-
scription is not allowed to be original and coeval to
the lower, this construction is necessary, and sdyul must
needs be referred to the following clause, and not, as l
have done it, to the preceding. Mr. Chishull is sensible
enough of this gross absurdity of speech; but he, out of
'fondness to this inscription, being willing to malie the
famous AEsop the statuary here, would palliate the ssew
with a more prorsus AEsopico, as if AEsop made both
statue and inscription too. But it will not do, though beasts
