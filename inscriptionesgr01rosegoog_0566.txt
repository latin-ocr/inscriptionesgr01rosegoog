Various readings.

James Gronovius hes made his copy more intelligible, hut
he does not seem tohave rigidly adhered to MSS. He, too,
has inserted φαν. Perhaps sina (from Glareanus's urm) might

serve, if Mr. K.'s idea be approved. Επανακαται is written in ι

most MSS, which Mr. Κ. derives from ακος, care, ανακως,
-cargfully5 whence e'sranorcu, or -καω, swavorum, enova-
καταε. Such violent strainiug to make the text literally agree
with the reading of the MSS. would be justly liable to suspicion
in any antient Greek author, whose works had been transcribed
by Greek copyers, and bad come down to us in a tolersble
state of correctness s—but, when we consider how miserably the
Latin scribes mangled or murdered the Greek passages which
their authors quoted3 many of which are left in a desperate
condition, unless we shall light on MSS. of greater age and
worth than we bave hitherto bad the good fortune to find3 in
this labyrinth of various readings, or rather of varieties of blun-
ders, it would be rash to promise ourselves a clue to directus
always to the genuine reading. ln cases of dialect, particularly,
these MSS. of Boethius oughtto be discarded as incompeteut
wimesses. We shall only add that the late Mr. Toup, having
occasion to speak of this decree, ou which he would probably
bave tried bia skill if he had not found the errors 'too numerous
and obstinate, dismissed it, only calling it corrupto corruptius.
(In Suidanv, v. Χιαζειν.)

Lest it should be said of us that we are apt enough to oh·
ject to the opinions ol others, without giving them an oppor-
tunity os making reprisals, we will present Mr. K. with the
latter part of the decree, as we think it probably ought to be
read:

Δέ3οχθαι περὶ τούτων vaip βασιλέαρ καὶ ‘reip Εφόρωρ
μέμψασθαι Τιμόθεον, ἑπανάγκαξαι δὲ sai τᾶν ἕνδεκα χορδᾶν
