Ι had intended to suhjoin a selection of inscriptions from the
papers ol my amiable and well informed relation Mr. E. Tupper;
but ou examination it appears,'that every thing ol any importance ,
has been anticipated by Clarke, Dodwell, Walpole, or others,
excepta long decree of thanks hy the people nl Salamis to The·

of ΗΟΔΟΙ the stone has HOAOi i. e. rideri. Respecting the
other, p. 325. l am enabled by the liiudnessof Mr. W. J. Bankes,
to give yon some informatinn. That gentleman saw a stone at
Agin serendi, resembling Mr. Tupper's, i. e. Grnpins’s drawing,
aud with characters upon it apparently ancient: hut this was in
. the dusk ol the evening, and he could not see to read them.
He does not remember to have heard any thing which would war·
rant a suspicion of forgery against Grnpius. The reading ol the
latter part is deplorably uncertain. Perhaps,
