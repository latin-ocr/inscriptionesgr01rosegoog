thereis uo reason to imagine, that this yerb was ever used by
the Greeks without the Ι subjoyned to the Ο. That it has
sometimes that form in the present editt. aud perhaps MSS.
amouuta to nothing3· nor is it of any moment, that ποιεῖν often
has the first syllable short, for indeed it cannot bs otherwise,
unless the l be doubled in pronunciatiou. But to allow, that
there is uo blunder in the form ΕΠΟΕΙΣΕΝ, it can only be au
argument, that El was sometimes used instead of the common
way of writing H. But this isforeign to the present dispute.
lustead of Elbll aud ΣΙΓΕΥΕΥΣΙ, which are iu Shuclrford's
copy, the other as you acquaiut me has EMl and ΣΥΚΕΕΥΣΙΝ.
Such a difference as this¹ disqualifies both copies for being of
any authority with respect to thess two words: nay, the credit
of the whole inscription is affected by it. Let ure add, that,
probably, at least, they both give the latter word an absnrd
form. 'lhere seems to be no reason for doubtiug, that it should
be ΣΙΓΕΙΕΫΣΙΝ according to that of ΣΙΓΕΙΕΣ. Upon the
whole, uo part¹of the inscription can be justly allowed to have
any weight in the present controversy, except the two words
llPY‘l'ANElON and zlrssluz: aud for whether of us these
declere, l need not mention. And here be pleused to consider,
whether it would uot' have been an extravagant wautouness to

Another authority referred to iu your Commentary is the
Delian inscription. 'l'u thia lobjected, that the inscription was
AEolic, and that, therefore, the power of the verb EMI was

that EMl is archaice for ElMl, and you, that it is ibelim, our
assertione are not binding, the one upon the other; but there
must be some third judgureut, some other topic to be concluded
by.‘' l answer, that supposing neither of ns could give a reason,
whereby his hypothesis might appear the more probable, our as·
sertions would amount to uo more than if we had both been
silent. So that even upon that footing the authority of this in·
scriptiou would be set aside3 and that would he enough for my
purpose. But further, the digamma F, which appears in the
inscription, isa strong argument for its beiug AEolic: for that
the digamma was peculiar to that dialect is at least highly pro·
