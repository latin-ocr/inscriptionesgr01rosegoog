You mention p. v. the 018818 in Herodotus 1. 4⁷. 88 given by
Muratori from some traveller's paperS. He had it from Cyriacus
AnconitanuS, No. 198. quoted by wesseling. This 18 probably one
instance in which the editor’s delinquencies have been laid to the
charge of Cyriacu8‚ and have brought his veracity in question.
(Maffei Art. Crit. Lap. p. 56.) He certainly does seem to say,
11181 118 saw the original at Delphi3 Ibidem justa [juxta] areti-
quissimam quercum in medio amphitheatri ad magnum et mar-
moreum lapidem. And why may not the 018818 have been taken
from Herodotus and put up 88 an 01888188181 inscription, public
or private¹2 The two first 111188, especially, might have sei-ved
88 a motto sor fifty thing83 and the editor, or 88 intermediam
scribe, might very well fancy that Cyriacus 11811 omitted the 1881,
88 being extant 111 well known books. One thing 18 81111881,
that κρατειρῆ οἶα χελώνης, line 3. 88188 from the printed
Herodotus.

P. 16. The Leucadian inscription is 80 wretchedly copied,
that some 11881188 must be given to conjecture. The 881188 seems

to have been something of this sort ς
