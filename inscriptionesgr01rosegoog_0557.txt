subjoined to tlie preposition nard for the same mason that,
though in Ervglish we say, “ennon down‚'' “ bear domn?
“ hunt down,'’ boc. we never say, '‘ injure down,'' “rurong deren,”
“ ltnrt domn,” &c- -

'lhe ellipsis of the causnl proposition, as before harpes-
onc'von, iscommon: but lcan lind no other instance of this
participle, ov the verh to which it belongs, ina passive form;
probably for no other reason than because there is rto other
passage estant in which it is required in s passive sense.

FETA2 or ἔτος may possibly mean of an ἑταιρεῖαι or
association, sanctioned by lsw, of persons liuhle or quslified to
serve the higher offices of the state, and therefore constituting
the lirst order. ' ,

ΤΕΛΕΣΤΑ, u percon of tle second order, Ι derive from
