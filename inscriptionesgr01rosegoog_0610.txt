Nos. ν. andvtr. were presented hy J. Hawkins‚ Esq. os Bignor
Parh, Sussex, who had received Novit. as a present from
Mr. Edward Lee, aanhey Merchant. No. v. was found in 1797,
“ precisely on the spot njhere the ruins of Dyme are to he sought

for.'' Mr. Howlrins.

In line 7. ΑΡΧΩΝ ie put hy mistalre ἰοῐΑΡΧΕΙΩΝ, (see
88.) and line 18. ΠΑΡΕΧΩΡΙΣΑ for ΠΑΡΕΧΩΡΗΣΑ, which
is a very ancient example of iotacism. As to line 14, I once
· thought that at'ter ΠΡΟΣ there had been some proper name,
especially as the Iombdos had much the appearance of imperfect
chit. But the letter is quite as small in ΟΛΗΣ line 8. The
graver seems to have put ΑΛΛΗΣ for ΑΛΛΗΛΟΥΣ. ln line
18. of a very long and very carious inscription copied by Mr. Hyde
in the Oasis, and admirahly made out hy Doctor Young and
M. Letronne, there is this phrase: (Class. Journal, No. xav.

p. 158.) ἵνα δὲ μηδαμόθεν (leptim wls πρός ἀλλήλους συναλλα- ’
