¹ Ν. Β. All Cadmeun letters, uo H or Ω. Η is the
Latin H, aspirato. ⁴

of the first inscription both the reading und interpretation
is'eesy: aud Mr. Chishull hss given it right. Phamdici sum
Hermocretis F. Proconesii: Creterem autem et Basin et
Colum sd Prytaneurn dedit Sigeensibus. Phanodici i. e.
δῶρον donum: I am the gift or present of Phanodicus, who

gave three vessels, tt Crater, a Bason, nnrl a Strainer, for
the use ol the Prytaueum. This inscription, as l tuke it,
was engmved on oue of those three vessels: and either at
first was transcribed upon this stone, to mnlre the bene-
faction lmowu to the commonalty without door, or else
nsterwards‚ when the vessels might be old, and· new cast,
to continue the memorial of ir.

The second inscription, Iconceive, wrts engraved on
another of these three vessels, but there is much ruore
difficulty in reading and distinguishing, that, thau the former.
But it is plain there is mention of the same present, us in
the other, a Crater, a Bason, or Stand, aud p Strainer:
only what io the first is called ὖποκρητῆριον is here called
’Enltrrnron This (if you suppose with me to be en·
graved on the vessels) was prudently done; for one of them
might be worn out, or lost before the ether; and tlte same

¹ guest, though noue was lost, might not look on them all. η

So that the memory of the benefaction was more secured, ἶ

by repeating the whole gift ‹rn each vessel.
